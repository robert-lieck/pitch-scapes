The implemented methods are described in (please cite when using this library for publications):

Lieck R, Rohrmeier M (2020) **Modelling Hierarchical Key Structure with Pitch Scapes**. In: *Proceedings of the 21st International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference*. Montréal, Canada

**Note:** I will progressively refactor my existing code and make it available as a clean library here. Please contact me if you have any questions or are missing anything!
